# Google_Text_to_Speech

## description:
This projection can help you get the synthesis speech from Google. As the method I used is using the Web_api, you do not need to install any Google's Libs. 

## Requirement:
Please make sure the vision of Python is Python2, unfortunately, you cannot use this code in Python3 without any modification!

## Notice:
Please replace your Google API_key in the code (I have marked for you) to make sure that you code runs well.
